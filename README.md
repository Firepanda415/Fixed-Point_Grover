# Fixed-Point_Grover

Implementation of N-Qubit (N>=2) Fixed Point Grover.

There are two notebooks. One is the paper implementation, the other is purely from $S(\alpha)$ and $S(\beta)$.
The latter one does not require an ancillary qubit but it assumes we already know what the target state is.

Will add more explaination to the code soon.
